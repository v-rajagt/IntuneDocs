# What is Microsoft Intune device management?

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

As an IT admin, you must ensure that managed devices are providing the resources that your users need to do their work, while protecting that data from risk.

The **Devices** workload gives you insights into the devices you manage, and lets you perform remote tasks on those devices.

## Get to your devices

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
3. Select **Devices**. This view shows detailed information about the individual devices, and what you can do with them, including:

   - **Overview** shows a visual snapshot of the enrolled devices, and also shows how many devices are using the different platforms, including Android, iOS, and more.
   - **All devices** shows a list of the enrolled devices you manage.

     Use the **Export** feature to create a .csv list of all the devices, in increments of 10,000 (Internet Explorer) or 30,000 (Microsoft Edge, Chrome).

     Select any device to [view additional details about that device](device-inventory.md), including hardware details, installed apps, its compliance policy status, and more.

   - **Azure AD devices** shows a list of the devices registered or joined with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Learn more about [Azure AD device management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction).
   - **Device actions** includes a history of the remote actions ran on different devices, including the action, its status, who initiated the action, and the time.

   - **Audit logs** is a record of activities that generate a change in Intune. [Audit logs](../fundamentals/monitor-audit-logs.md) provides more details.
   - **TeamViewer Connector** is a service that allows users of Intune-managed Android devices to get remote assistance from their IT administrator. Learn more about [TeamViewer](teamviewer-support.md).
   - **Help and Support** provides a shortcut on troubleshooting tips, requesting support, or checking the status of Intune.
